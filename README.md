This is the monorepo for Luua, which is made of:

- A REST API (a rails app), located here (under `/`)
- A NextJS (React) web app, located under `/frontend`


## ðŸš§ Disclaimer

This project is a **work in progress**, and is not working yet.


## How to run the API locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:lambda2/luua.git

cd luua

# Copy the config file
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# EDIT THE config file with your database credentials & cie

# Setup the database and seed the initial data
./bin/setup

```
